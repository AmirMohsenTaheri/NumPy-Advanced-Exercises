# 28 Advanced Questions for Learning and Practice the [NumPy](https://numpy.org/) Library

## About Collection
In this collection, 28 advanced questions from the **NumPy** library have been gathered. Efforts have been made to include well-known and widely-used functions and methods of NumPy. By using these questions, you can practice and learn the NumPy library, which is one of the most commonly used tools in **machine learning**.

## Numpy
The NumPy library is one of the most widely used libraries for working with numbers, arrays, and matrices. By default, Python only supports arrays and variables for simple mathematical operations. The NumPy package is specifically designed for working with numbers through matrices and multi-dimensional arrays. NumPy is one of the most commonly used tools in data mining, machine learning, and deep learning, leading to increased programming speed.

By using NumPy's n-dimensional arrays (ndarray), one can overcome the limitations of Python lists, which require the use of loops for operations, thereby increasing efficiency. The main limitation of NumPy's n-dimensional arrays compared to Python lists is that all elements must be of the same data type. However, the operations performed using n-dimensional arrays are faster.
